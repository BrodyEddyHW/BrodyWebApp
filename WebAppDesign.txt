Game Overview:
The game is a Harvard-Westlake-based adaptation of GeoGuessr. Each day, players are given a photo of a location 
somewhere on campus, and using a detailed map of the school, they must guess the spot of the location in the photo 
as accurately as possible. A daily leaderboard tracks scores, and is based on proximity to the actual location and 
the speed of the guess. 

Theme/Color Scheme:
 - red/black/gold theme (HW colors)
 - aesthetic picture of HW in the background, like the field at a sunset or something
 - game logo in the center, and a “play game” or “play now” button underneath
 - play game button would be in the middle, oval shaped, red with white text
 - leaderboard on the left side of the screen, rectangle with rounded corners, black with 
 - white text displaying name, score, and time it took. Format would be: 
        “placement”	“name”	“score”		“time”
 - small rules list on the right side, same format as leaderboard

 - once a player clicks the play game button, they are taken to a new screen where the daily picture takes up the whole screen 
 - minimap in the top right corner that would expand on click and allows for zooming in
 - when people choose location, a little marker shows where they click
 - an oval button in red on the bottom middle that says “submit guess”
 - map is a birds-eye view of HW upper school campus that has white text labels for the different buildings
 - timer counting in the top left corner, formate is:  Time: “minute”: “second”

 - end screen after submitting guess shows updated leaderboard in the center of the screen, 
   with your new score having an outline to highlight it
 - three buttons underneath, one to see the picture again, one to share your score, and one to return to the main screen

Typography:
 - primary is probably like a bold or semi-bold lato
 - secondary is probably just a regular or light lato
