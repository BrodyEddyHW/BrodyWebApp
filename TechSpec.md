# Tech Specification for HW Minimap Game

---

## Overview

The HW Minimap Game is an adaptation of GeoGuessr, designed for Harvard-Westlake students. Players are shown a static image of a campus location and must guess its corresponding position on a minimap. The game provides immediate feedback on the distance between the player's guess and the correct location. Players can submit their scores to a daily leaderboard. The app features a visually appealing UI with Harvard-Westlake branding.
